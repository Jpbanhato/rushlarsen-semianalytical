# Semi-Analytical Implementation of Rush-Larsen Method
This repository contains a semi-analytical implementation of the Rush-Larsen method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in cardiac electrophysiology. The project focuses on optimizing the solution of models such as the Minimal Ventricular Model by Bueno-Orovio through a combination of traditional numerical techniques and analytical approaches to reduce computational overhead and improve accuracy.

Key features include:

- Semi-analytical approach: Combines numerical methods with closed-form solutions to enhance stability and efficiency.
- Rush-Larsen Method: Applies the Rush-Larsen method, widely used in cardiac modeling for efficient integration of gating variables.
- Minimal Ventricular Model (Bueno-Orovio): A model of cardiac dynamics that captures the essential behavior of ventricular action potentials.
This implementation aims to balance the accuracy of full numerical solutions with the efficiency of semi-analytical methods, specifically tailored to cardiac electrophysiology applications.
